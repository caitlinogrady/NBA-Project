# NBA-Project
This was a project done for my data oriented programming class in 2023. The point of this project was use an API to generate databases and data visualization. It was a group project, and my contributions were handling the database, data, and visualizations of the NBA.

I worked with the NBA RapidAPI. However, I shifted focus from individual player statistics and rather focused on team statistics during one season. I gathered the statistics from the 2020 season on NBA teams points, points in the paint, rebounds, assists, personal fouls, steals, turnovers, and blocks.
